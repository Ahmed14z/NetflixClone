# NetflixClone
A netflix clone i completed using freeCodeCamp Video on youtube , i learned alot from this project and added my own functions to it !

What i Completed alone : 
1- updated the Play and Download button on the Main View since they were not mentioned in the video
2- i fixed the download button that appears when the user chooses a movie since it was not working.
